		title:'SnitchMaxxing',
		description: `A computer vision anti-cheating tool that can be used by teachers to automatically detect if students are looking at other students' papers and cheating  during exams. The program analyzes the faces of students and is able to figure out in what direction the face is pointing and in what direction the eyes are looking. It is then able to assess whether the student is looking away from their exam, and notifies the teacher if that is the case.`,
